Expense Tracker
    A Python-based command-line application to track, categorize, and analyze expenses.
    It stores data in CSV files, uses Pandas for analytics, and Matplotlib for generating insightful charts.
    
Features:
    Add Expenses: Record expenses with description, amount, and date.
    Auto-Categorization: Expenses are categorized automatically using keyword rules (e.g., Starbucks → Dining, Uber → Transport).
    Reports:
        Monthly Report – View total spending, category breakdown, and top merchants.
        All-Time Summary – See cumulative spending across months and categories.
    Visualizations:
        Line charts for monthly spending trends.
        Bar or pie charts for category-wise spending.

Tech Stack:
    Python 3
    Pandas – for expense data analysis
    Matplotlib – for charts and graphs
    CSV – simple storage format

How It Works:
